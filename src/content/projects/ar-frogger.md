This was a one of three projects with a partner in a Special Topics course covering Augmented Reality. The goal of this project was to cover mid-air tracking using the Vuforia plugin for Unity. Our assignment was to build frogger in AR. The game loop is as follows: Beginning with placing the starting platform in front of the camera, then five floating platforms that grow as the user holds the screen, and then the ending platform.

Once the setup is complete the player needs to walk within range of their frog to activate it. The player aims their camera in the direction they want the frog to jump, presses and holds to charge the jump, and the frog jumps when they release. The player has 10 lives to make it to the end, once a platform is reached it acts as a checkpoint.
