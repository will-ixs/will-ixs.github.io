[Revenge of the Pharaoh](https://sandstorm-interactive.itch.io/revenge-of-the-pharaoh) is the project a top down dungeon crawler game developed over a semester long game development course at my university. Our group consisted of two artists and four programmers. We started by deciding on some mechanics and a vibe/theme for the game, created our narrative from that and made a Game Design Document. We made weekly reports of progress and had set certain milestones to hit throughout the semester. 

Personally I was responsible for the design and implementation of the character controller, regular enemy spawning system, the Serpopards' boss fight, and the Pharaoh's boss fight.
